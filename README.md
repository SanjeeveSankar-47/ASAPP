## About

ASAPP is a mixed stack project with a Python-heavy codebase and a JavaScript frontend. This repository may contain API services, utilities, and a frontend UI. This README provides a general setup and workflow to get the project running locally and help future contributors onboard quickly.

---

## Features

- Python backend services (APIs, workers, or scripts)
- Tests for both backend and frontend (where present)

---

## Tech stack

- Backend: Python (versions 3.8+ recommended)
- Frontend: streamlit
- backend: FastAPI

---

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get a development environment running.

### Prerequisites

Install these tools on your machine:

- Git
- Python 3.8+ (3.11 recommended)
- pip (or pipx / pipenv)
- Optional: virtualenv or venv for Python

### Local setup (Python)

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/SanjeeveSankar-47/ASAPP.git
   cd ASAPP

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   - macOS / Linux:
     source .venv/bin/activate
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Install Python dependencies
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt

(If the repository uses Poetry or Pipenv, adapt these steps to `poetry install` or `pipenv install`.)


Return to the project root to run backend services as needed.

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root (or in relevant service folders) with the required configuration. Example variables:

- FLASK_ENV=development
- SECRET_KEY=replace_with_secure_random_string
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
- API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Be sure not to commit secrets. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

---

## Usage

Example: run the backend API locally

1. Activate the Python virtual environment

- FastAPI / Uvicorn example:
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload

---

## Running tests

- Python (pytest)
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  pytest -q


If there are no tests configured, consider adding unit and integration tests for critical functionality.

---

## Project structure (suggested / common)

This is an example layout — match it to the actual repository structure:

- /app or /src — Python application code
- /scripts — utility or deployment scripts
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
- package.json — Node dependencies and scripts
- README.md — this file

Adjust and expand this section to reflect the actual repository layout.

---

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

2. Keep changes small and focused. Add tests for new features or bug fixes.

3. Open a PR to `main` (or the repository's default branch) with a clear description of the changes.

4. Follow the repository's code style and run linters/formatters before submitting.

If you want a contribution guide or issue templates added, open an issue or submit a PR with those files.

If you'd like me to customize this README further (add setup instructions specific to a framework used in the repo, detect and list real scripts from package.json, or include actual project structure after reading the repository), tell me and I can update it.
